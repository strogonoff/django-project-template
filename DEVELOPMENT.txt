Development Recommendations
===========================

* Write Less instead of CSS.
  Set up automatic compilation of .less files to .css in the same directory.

* Install on-the-fly syntax/coding style validation in your editor.
  Under VIM, Syntastic works great.

  TODO: Provide examples of code checker setups in other popular editors.
